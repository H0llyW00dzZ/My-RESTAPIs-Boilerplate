// Package oauth2 provides an OAuth2 authentication manager for web applications.
//
// This package is a refactored version of my own Perfect OAuth2-CLI implementation, adapted for use in a website boilerplate.
// It aims to simplify the integration of OAuth2 authentication into web applications by providing a convenient and
// reusable authentication manager.
//
// # Reasons for implementing OAuth2 in this boilerplate
//
//  1. Simplified Authentication: OAuth2 provides a standardized and secure way to authenticate users using external
//     identity providers, such as Google, GitHub, or Facebook. By implementing OAuth2 in the boilerplate, developers
//     can easily integrate authentication functionality into their web applications without starting from scratch.
//
//  2. Improved User Experience: OAuth2 allows users to authenticate using their existing accounts from popular identity
//     providers, eliminating the need for creating separate accounts for each application. This provides a seamless and
//     familiar login experience for users, enhancing the overall user experience of the web application.
//
//  3. Reduced Development Effort: Implementing OAuth2 authentication from scratch can be time-consuming and complex.
//     By including a pre-built OAuth2 package in the boilerplate, developers can save significant development effort
//     and focus on building the core functionality of their web application.
//
//  4. Extensibility and Customization: The OAuth2 package in this boilerplate is designed to be extensible and
//     customizable. Developers can easily add support for additional OAuth2 providers or modify the existing
//     implementation to suit their specific requirements. The package provides a solid foundation for OAuth2
//     authentication, which can be further enhanced and adapted as needed.
//
// # Disclaimer
//
// Please note that while this OAuth2 package provides a starting point for implementing OAuth2 authentication in web
// applications, it is still a work in progress and may require further improvements and testing before being considered
// production-ready. Developers are encouraged to review and enhance the package based on their specific security
// requirements, performance considerations, and best practices for OAuth2 implementation.
//
// The package currently supports Google as an OAuth2 provider, but adding support for other providers is planned for
// future iterations. Contributions and feedback from the community are welcome to help improve and expand the
// functionality of this OAuth2 package.
//
// When using this package in a production environment, it is crucial to thoroughly test and validate the
// implementation, ensure proper error handling, and follow the latest OAuth2 security guidelines and best practices.
// It is also recommended to keep the package up to date with any security patches or updates released by the OAuth2
// provider.
//
// By providing this OAuth2 package in the boilerplate, we aim to offer a solid foundation for implementing
// authentication in web applications while acknowledging the need for continuous improvement and adaptation to meet
// the specific requirements of each project.
