> [!NOTE]
> For users in Indonesia (ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©), it's recommended to use the Singapore region instead of Indonesia when creating a cluster with a cloud provider. This is due to the traditional instability of the network in Indonesia (our home), which can lead to issues such as latency and packet loss.
