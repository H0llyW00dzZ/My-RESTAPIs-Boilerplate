# MySQL Startup CPU Boost for a microservices Kubernetes cluster.
#
# Install the component before applying https://github.com/google/kube-startup-cpu-boost, then modify the "containerName"
#
# Note: This works well. However, for Golang binaries, this is not really affected much since Golang binaries are already faster.
