# Note: When using CoreDNS with HPA, it is not recommended to use DNS local caching.
# Misconfiguration DNS local caching can lead to significant issues (e.g., can lead to stale DNS entries and connectivity problems).
# CoreDNS scales better with HPA because it is primarily CPU-bound and can be effective when multiple HPAs are in use, not just in this repository.
# Additionally, this can improve latency as it synchronizes with other HPA deployments (e.g., REST APIs in this repo), including the stable ingress-nginx VPA.
# Average latency (regional):
# ;; Query time: 30msec ~ ;; Query time: 10msec
#
# Note that achieving average latency across multiple regions (global) is possible, but it is quite complex.
