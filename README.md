# My RESTful API Boilerplate

This project provides a boilerplate for building RESTful APIs using Go. It is designed to a quick start with best practices, easy configuration, and a clear project structure.

## Features

- Use Fiber Framework
- Pre-configured MySQL and Redis integration
- Middleware examples for logging and authentication
- Scalable project structure
- Dual-licensed under BSD 3-Clause and MIT (specific files)
- High Performance (Thanks to the [`Sonic JSON serializing & deserializing library`](https://github.com/bytedance/sonic))

## TODO Features

- [ ] Custom Monitoring Integration with Kubernetes ecosystems, such as Grafana, etc. at the top level


> [!NOTE]  
> Additional features will be added later as my primary focus is on using this with the Fiber framework.

## Motivation

The motivation for sharing this RESTful API Boilerplate on GitHub is to streamline my development process, ensuring I don't have to start from scratch each time. It's a robust, secure foundation that adheres to best practices, designed for quick and efficient project initiation.

## Philosophy

This boilerplate is grounded in the Unix philosophy, emphasizing simplicity, modularity, and reusability. Each component is designed to do one thing and do it well, with the ability to combine components seamlessly to perform complex tasks. This approach ensures that the boilerplate remains lightweight, efficient, and easy to maintain.

## Resource Memory Usage

- `MySQL` without `Redis` + 100K `POST` Request

> [!NOTE]
> The `Resource Memory Usage` section demonstrates how `Go` has stable and low memory overhead compared to other languages, especially `Java` hahaha.

## Architecture

Below is the architecture of this boilerplate and how it looks. I created this for REST APIs about volcano ðŸŒ‹ monitoring used by the government, so it can easily monitor volcanoes in the real world.

- Backend (Pure `Go`)

```
backend/
|-- cmd/
|   `-- server/ (main application entry point)
|       `-- main.go
|-- pkg/
|   |-- restapis/ (API route handlers)
|   |-- any/ (any related code)
|-- internal/ (private application and library code)
|   |-- any/ (any related code)
|-- .env (optional environment variables since it can placed anywhere)
`-- go.mod (dependencies)
```

- Frontend (Any Framework `TS` e.g, React,NextJS or pure `JS` for `HTMX`)

#### Example:

```
frontend/
|-- pages/
|   |-- api/ (optional, for Next.js API routes if needed)
|   |-- _app.js (global page layouts and state)
|   |-- index.js (home page)
|   `-- [...other pages]
|-- public/ (static files like images, fonts)
|-- src/
|   |-- components/ (shared React components)
|   |   `-- [various components]
|   |-- styles/ (global styles, theme)
|   |-- hooks/ (custom React hooks)
|   |-- utils/ (utility functions)
|   |-- lib/ (libraries and configurations)
|   `-- context/ (React context files for state management)
|-- .env.local (environment variables)
|-- next.config.js (Next.js configuration)
`-- package.json (dependencies and scripts)
```
